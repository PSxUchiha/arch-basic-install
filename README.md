This is my repo for the basic arch install that I keep handy because fr installing arch everytime can be a drag as my system tends to break quite often and I also like to try out various DEs and WMs.

So just clone this repo, make a few necessary changes to the username and passwords or comment out any packages you don't need and there you have a fresh arch install without going through the pain of typing countless commands for an hour or so.

P.S create the partitions first and mount them. This is supposed to run assuming you have already done that much.
